## Three Speculative Claims

One of the earliest articulations of something approaching modern cell theory was three claims by Theodor Schwann - known for Schwann cells in 1839.

### Schwann's Claims About Cells

1. The cell is the unit of structure, physiology and organization in living things.

2. The cell retains a dual existence as a distinct entity and a building block in the construction of organisms.

3. Cells form by free-cell formation, similar to formation of crystals.

### Three Speculative Claims Aboutn Neural Networks

1. Features: Features are the fundamental unit of neural networks. they correspond to directions. These features can be rigorously studies and understood.

2. Circuits: Features are connected by weights, forming circuits. These can also be rigorously stduied and understood.

3. Universality: Analogous features and circuits form across models and tasks.

### Claim 1 : Features

- In a neural networks, Early layers contain features like edge or curve detectors, while later layers have features like floppy ear detectors or wheel detectors.

- Curve detecting neurons can be found in every non-trivial vision model carefully examined.

- These units are interesting because they straddle the boundary between features the community broadly agrees exist (e.g. edge detectors) and features for which there's significant skepticism.

- Curve detectors are found in families of units, with each member of the family detecting the same curve features in a different orientation.
